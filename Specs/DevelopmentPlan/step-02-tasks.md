# Step 02 Tasks â€” Semantic Layout Skeleton

1. Add or update the `<!doctype html>` document to include `lang`, meta viewport, and canonical tags per the spec.
2. Insert a skip link positioned as the first focusable element targeting `#main`.
3. Define the global landmark structure: `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>` with appropriate `aria-label`s where beneficial.
4. Within `<main>`, scaffold sub-sections with descriptive IDs/classes: hero, stay-in-touch (primary form), mission, plain-english.
5. Place placeholder forms with proper `<form>`, `<label>`, `<input>`, `<button>` markup (no styling yet) and unique IDs for each input.
6. Ensure heading hierarchy follows H1 in hero, H2 for sections, subordinate headings as needed.
7. Commit the structural changes for review (no visual polish expected at this stage).
