# Step 03 Report â€” Hero & Branding Implementation

## Work Completed
- Added direct hero call-to-action link jumping to the Stay in Touch section.
- Applied full hero gradient per spec, using a seven-stop diagonal blend with grain overlay and soft-light treatment.
- Introduced uppercase hero typography with line-by-line spans to match "DYSLEXIC / ENERGY.COM" layout and responsive scaling.
- Added an eight-point star field (four large, four small) with amplified glow and twinkle animation respecting `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Updated mission copy + tagline styling and refreshed form privacy text with direct links to new `/privacy/` and `/accessibility/` pages.
- Removed duplicated Stay in Touch form from the footer to reduce redundancy while retaining legal links and cookie note.
- Expanded global design tokens in `css/styles.css`, covering fonts, heading spacing, focus treatments, and footer styling.
- Scaffolded dedicated Privacy and Accessibility statement pages (now at `/privacy/` and `/accessibility/`) sharing header/footer templates with updated copy.
- Embedded required Mailchimp loader snippet on the holding page so future form integration has the expected dependency.

## Outstanding / Follow-up
- Integrate Open Dyslexic font once hosting approach is confirmed (download supplied via https://antijingoist.itch.io/opendyslexic) so Step 05 toggle can load it reliably.
- Add hero decorative grain asset refinements if design team prefers supplied texture over generated SVG noise.
- Future steps will refine accessibility menu (Step 05) and complete form submission logic (Step 04).

## Verification Notes
- Manual checks confirm skip link contrast on gradient background and decorative stars marked `aria-hidden` via `role="presentation"`.
- Mobile viewport ensures hero text maintains ~80% width and stars remain in corners without overlapping content.
- Footer now carries the no-cookies disclosure per clarifying notes and references the single primary Stay in Touch form after removing the duplicate footer form.
