# Step 04 Report â€” Content & Forms

## Work Completed
- Replaced the Stay in Touch form with the official Mailchimp embed inside `index.html`, restyling the markup to match site semantics while preserving accessibility (ARIA relationships, honeypot, privacy copy).
- Implemented friendly validation and submission scaffold in `scripts/forms.js`, including whimsical success/error messaging and Mailchimp-ready fetch logic now pointing at the real list endpoint.
- Added form UI feedback styles in `css/styles.css` for error states, success messaging, and the hero CTA link that jumps to the form anchor.
- Updated planning docs (`step-04-tasks.md`, `step-04-review.md`) so expectations match the single primary form per latest requirements.

## Outstanding / Follow-up
- Consider adding integration tests (or cURL smoke tests) to monitor success/failure responses from the live Mailchimp endpoint.

## Verification Notes
- Manual tests: invalid email triggers whimsical error, valid email shows success placeholder and resets form; focus returns to email on error.
- Skip link + hero CTA both reach the Stay in Touch form without layout shifts on mobile/desktop.
- Footer messaging references privacy/accessibility pages and no second form, matching stakeholder direction.
