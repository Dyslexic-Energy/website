# Remaining Work — Dyslexic Energy Launch

## Outstanding Tasks
- [ ] Run automated accessibility scans (`npx html-validate`, `npx pa11y`, axe) and document any mitigation notes once network access is available.
- [ ] Optimise assets for production (image compression, confirm lazy-loading, evaluate critical CSS) and note changes.
- [ ] Validate Lighthouse performance scores (mobile & desktop) meet the agreed budgets (≤2.5 s FCP, TBT <200 ms desktop / <300 ms mobile).
- [ ] Deploy the current build to GitHub Pages via Cloudflare, verify `https://dyslexicenergy.com` serves the latest assets, and confirm CSS loads in production.
- [ ] Share the post-launch monitoring plan with stakeholders (owner, metrics, response process) and log it in the tracker.
- [ ] Capture final responsive screenshots (hero in default/dark/high-contrast themes, Stay in Touch form, policy pages) for the design archive.
