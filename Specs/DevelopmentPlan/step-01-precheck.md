- Confirm you have read `Specs/website_spec.txt` end-to-end and taken notes on each numbered section.
- Open `Specs/Designs/wireframe.jpg` and any additional mocks provided; ensure you can reference them during implementation.
- Ensure `Specs/clarifying_questions.md` exists and list any unknowns (form endpoint, analytics provider, typography source, etc.).
- Verify access to existing site assets (`css/`, `scripts/`, `index.html`) so the audit can capture current gaps.
- Identify the review lead who will sign off on this step and document their name in the `step-01-review.md` file header.
