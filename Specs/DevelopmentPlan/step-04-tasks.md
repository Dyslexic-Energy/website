# Step 04 Tasks â€” Content & Forms

1. Insert final Mission and Plain English copy into their sections with semantic tags (`<section>`, `<h2>`, `<p>`).
2. Build the primary Stay in Touch form below hero with labelled email input, ARIA live region for messages, and privacy note.
3. Duplicate the form in the footer with unique IDs/names to avoid collisions, sharing validation logic.
4. Implement client-side validation (HTML5 attributes + JS enhancements) with accessible error summaries.
5. Connect forms to the chosen submission endpoint or stub with TODO comments pending integration answer.
6. Style the forms responsively (single column on mobile) using existing tokens and ensure focus states are visible.
7. Update tests or manual checklists to include form validation scenarios.
