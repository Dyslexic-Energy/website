# Step 04 Report â€” Content & Forms

## Work Completed
- Refined the Stay in Touch form markup (`index.html`) with ARIA relationships, Mailchimp pending flag, and whimsical copy linking back to the privacy statement.
- Implemented friendly validation and submission scaffold in `scripts/forms.js`, including whimsical success/error messaging, Mailchimp-ready fetch logic, and graceful fallback while the action URL is pending.
- Added form UI feedback styles in `css/styles.css` for error states, success messaging, and the hero CTA link that jumps to the form anchor.
- Updated planning docs (`step-04-tasks.md`, `step-04-review.md`) so expectations match the single primary form per latest requirements.

## Outstanding / Follow-up
- Mailchimp action URL + list identifiers are still needed to replace the temporary `data-mailchimp="pending"` state (see clarifying question 1).
- Consider adding integration tests once the production endpoint is available to verify submission success/failure flows.

## Verification Notes
- Manual tests: invalid email triggers whimsical error, valid email shows success placeholder and resets form; focus returns to email on error.
- Skip link + hero CTA both reach the Stay in Touch form without layout shifts on mobile/desktop.
- Footer messaging references privacy/accessibility pages and no second form, matching stakeholder direction.
