# Clarifying Questions

1. **Email capture endpoint** — What service or API should both sign-up forms submit to (e.g., Mailchimp, custom endpoint, static form provider)?
2. **Privacy link destination** — Which URL should the privacy microcopy reference, and is there existing copy we should mirror?
3. **Accessibility statement link** — Do we have an approved Accessibility Statement URL or draft content to link against?
4. **Typography sourcing** — Should we license Helvetica Bold, use an alternative (e.g., Neuzeit Grotesk), or self-host Atkinson Hyperlegible for dyslexia mode?
5. **Grain overlay asset** — Does a specific grain texture exist for the hero background, or should we generate one (SVG / PNG) within the repo?
6. **Analytics configuration** — Confirm whether Plausible is the desired provider and provide the domain configuration snippet if so.
7. **Form validation messaging** — Are there approved tone/style guidelines for success and error copy beyond generic defaults?
8. **Star icons reference** — Are there preferred star illustrations (SVG assets) from brand guidelines, or should we implement custom CSS/SVG shapes?
9. **Legal compliance** — Any regional compliance requirements (GDPR consent, cookie banners) to handle alongside the sign-up forms?
10. **Deployment target** — Confirm the target hosting platform (GitHub Pages vs. Netlify) and any build tooling expectations (pure static vs. pipeline).
