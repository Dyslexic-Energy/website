# Step 06 Report â€” Footer & Global Polish

## Work Completed
- Slimmed `wrap` spacing for Stay in Touch, Mission, and Plain English sections by adding `.wrap--tight`, reducing vertical gaps while keeping readability.
- Refined footer layout across `index.html`, `privacy/index.html`, and `accessibility/index.html` with grid-based structure, brand copy, and legal links.
- Extended `css/styles.css` to support footer grid, compact section padding, and flex column page layout.

## Outstanding / Follow-up
- Confirm footer copy (brand blurb/contact) with stakeholders before launch.
- Capture responsive screenshots to verify footer alignment and compact sections on tablet/mobile.

## Verification Notes
- Manual QA ensures header dropdown overlays content without shifting layout and footer stays full-bleed.
- Compact sections maintain accessible spacing (heading + paragraph) on mobile and desktop.
