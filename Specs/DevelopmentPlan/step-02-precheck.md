# Step 02 Precheck â€” Semantic Layout Skeleton

- Confirm Step 01 review is signed off.
- Decide whether the layout work happens on a feature branch; if so, note branch name here.
- Ensure a rollback plan exists (e.g., stash or branch) before editing `index.html` and `css/styles.css`.
- Gather spacing, grid, and breakpoint notes from the spec and designs for ready reference.
- Prepare placeholder copy for forms and sections so focus can stay on structure first.
