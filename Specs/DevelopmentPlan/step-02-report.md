# Step 02 Report â€” Semantic Layout Skeleton

## Work Completed
- Generated new `index.html` establishing document head, canonical meta, landmarks (`header`, `main`, `footer`), skip link, and semantically labelled sections (`hero`, `stay-in-touch`, `mission`, `plain-english`, `footer-cta`).
- Added accessible placeholders for both Stay in Touch forms with labelled inputs, ARIA live regions, and distinct IDs (`signup-primary`, `signup-footer`).
- Introduced `css/styles.css` with neutral base styles (layout, spacing, focus states) while deferring brand visuals to later steps.
- Created script stubs (`scripts/year.js`, `scripts/accessibility-menu.js`, `scripts/forms.js`) to prevent missing-file errors and prepare for future functionality.
- Added placeholder legal links targeting the forthcoming Privacy and Accessibility pages noted in clarifying questions.

## Outstanding Items
- Await confirmation of form endpoint, legal page URLs, and accessibility toggle specifics (tracked in `Specs/clarifying_questions.md`).
- Hero branding, gradients, star elements, and full accessibility menu logic intentionally deferred to Steps 03 and 05.
- Form validation and submission integration deferred to Step 04.

## Verification Notes
- HTML passes manual inspection for heading hierarchy (H1 hero, subsequent H2 sections).
- Skip link targets `#main` and is the first focusable element.
- Structural CSS avoids brand styling to keep review focused on semantics.
