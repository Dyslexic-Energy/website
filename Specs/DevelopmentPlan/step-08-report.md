# Step 08 Report — Snag List Fixes

## Items Addressed
- Accessibility button redesigned to "accessibility blue" (#0073E6) with 4px border and text; dark theme variant lightened to #4DABFF while maintaining contrast.
- Footer now includes "Made with love in Midsomer Norton" metadata line on all pages.
- Accessibility menu reset action renamed to title case (“Reset Preferences”) and inherits contextual text colours in light/dark modes.
- Reduced vertical spacing for sections and added `.wrap--tight` modifier to keep Stay in Touch, Mission, and Plain English blocks compact.

## Verification Notes
- Menu remains hidden until toggled; overlay positioning confirmed post-style changes.
- Dark and high-contrast modes display accessible blue variants and white text as expected.
- Section headings retain adequate breathing room after padding changes (checked at 320px, 768px, 1280px).

## Outstanding
- Re-run automated audits (html-validate, Pa11y, Lighthouse) once network access is available to confirm no regressions after visual tweaks.
