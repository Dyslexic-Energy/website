# Step 04 Tasks â€” Content & Forms

1. Insert final Mission and Plain English copy into their sections with semantic tags (`<section>`, `<h2>`, `<p>`).
2. Build (or refine) the primary Stay in Touch form below the hero with labelled email input, ARIA live region for messages, and privacy note.
3. If a secondary form is required later, duplicate the logic with unique IDs; for now keep footer copy linking back to the main form per latest guidance.
4. Implement client-side validation (HTML5 attributes + JS enhancements) with accessible error summaries.
5. Connect forms to the chosen submission endpoint or stub with TODO comments pending integration answer.
6. Style the forms responsively (single column on mobile) using existing tokens and ensure focus states are visible.
7. Update tests or manual checklists to include form validation scenarios (mobile + desktop).
