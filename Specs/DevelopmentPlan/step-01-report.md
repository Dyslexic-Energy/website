# Step 01 Report — Requirements Alignment

## Spec Breakdown
- **Purpose (Sec. 1):** Build an accessible holding page that introduces Dyslexic Energy, reinforces rainbow-forward branding, delivers mission and educational content, and includes two sign-up forms plus an accessibility control menu.
- **Layout (Sec. 2):** Single-page structure with branded header, hero, mission, explainer, and footer. Hero requires gradient, stars, and centralised copy. Both header and footer must host sign-up opportunities.
- **Branding (Sec. 3):** Hero gradient transitions from maroon through warm/cool hues with grain overlay; typography bold geometric sans, uppercase; four decorative glow stars positioned at hero corners.
- **Accessibility Menu (Sec. 4):** Dropdown triggered from header top-right, keyboard navigable, with toggles for dark mode, text scaling, dyslexia-friendly font, high contrast, and reduced motion—settings persisted via `localStorage` and seeded from system preferences.
- **Content (Sec. 5):** Prescribed copy for Stay in Touch forms, Mission, and Dyslexia in Plain English must be used verbatim; forms need validation, ARIA live regions, and privacy copy.
- **Footer (Sec. 6):** Full-bleed dark background (#0F0F12) with light text, secondary sign-up form, legal links, and copyright.
- **Accessibility & Compliance (Sec. 7):** WCAG 2.2 AA colour contrast, keyboard operability, semantic structure, zoom resilience, skip link, reduce motion support.
- **Responsive Design (Sec. 8):** Three breakpoints—mobile (≤600px), tablet (600–1024px), desktop (≥1024px)—with hero scaling, forms stacking, mission/explainer layout adjustments.
- **Technical Notes (Sec. 9):** Plain HTML/CSS/JS stack, use CSS/SVG for visuals, lazy-load non-critical assets, host statically, integrate privacy-first analytics.
- **Deliverables & Wireframe (Sec. 10–11):** Provide multi-device mockups, final code, accessibility audit, and align with referenced wireframe showing hero-first layout.

## Design Asset Observations
- `Specs/Designs/wireframe.jpg` confirms hero-led single-page layout with immediate sign-up block and stacked information sections.
- `Specs/Designs/brand_example_1.png` & `brand_example_2.png` showcase rainbow palette, star motifs, and typography weight; ensure these colour stops and glow treatments inform CSS tokens.
- No component-level spacing metrics are embedded in wireframe; will require approval once detailed CSS is drafted.

## Current Implementation Audit
- Repository root lacks `index.html`, `css/`, and `scripts/` directories referenced in prior commits; the holding page needs full recreation.
- `Specs/MailChimpScript.js` contains an embedded Mailchimp loader snippet—confirm if this should power both sign-up forms or if an alternative provider is now preferred.
- No existing accessibility menu assets or JS modules present; Step 05 will require net-new development.

## Dependencies & Risks
- **Email service:** Need endpoint credentials and confirmation whether Mailchimp script remains valid for current audience list.
- **Typography:** Licensing/source for Helvetica Bold or approved substitute plus Atkinson Hyperlegible for dyslexia mode.
- **Analytics:** Spec suggests Plausible; requires domain/site setup and script tag.
- **Grain overlay:** Determine if asset will be generated or supplied to avoid performance issues.
- **Legal copy:** Privacy policy and accessibility statement destinations must be confirmed before launch.

## Acceptance Criteria Prep
- Review checklists for Steps 02–07 already capture acceptance points derived from spec; update per reviewer feedback before execution.
- Pending answers to clarifying questions will feed into future step reviews (see `Specs/clarifying_questions.md`).

## Next Actions
1. Await stakeholder responses to outstanding clarifications.
2. Nominate reviewer for Step 01 and record in `step-01-review.md` once confirmation is received.
3. Upon approval, proceed to Step 02 following documented prechecks.
