# Step 01 Tasks â€” Requirements Alignment

1. Summarise each section of `Specs/website_spec.txt` into a shared document or ticket comment, highlighting success criteria and measurable outcomes.
2. Cross-check the spec against `Specs/Designs/wireframe.jpg`; document any visual details not spelled out in the spec (spacing, icon placement, etc.).
3. Audit the current repository (`index.html`, `css/styles.css`, `scripts/`) and note discrepancies versus the spec (missing sections, accessibility gaps, design differences).
4. Capture dependencies and risks (e.g., font licensing, localStorage limits, sign-up integration) in project tracking.
5. Update `Specs/clarifying_questions.md` with unresolved questions and tag the responsible stakeholder for answers.
6. Draft acceptance criteria for each subsequent step and copy the relevant items into their `review` files as needed.
7. Share the consolidated findings with the review lead for acknowledgement before moving to Step 02.
