# Step 06 Tasks — Footer & Global Polish

1. Implement footer styling with full-bleed dark background, ensuring it anchors to bottom on short pages.
2. Add the secondary Stay in Touch form styling consistent with the primary form while fitting the dark theme.
3. Insert legal links (Privacy Policy, Accessibility Statement) pointing to standalone pages that reuse the site header/footer template, once those pages exist.
4. Add © Dyslexic Energy 2025 text and ensure the year auto-updates via `scripts/year.js` or similar helper.
5. Refine global spacing, typography, and component tokens to maintain consistency across sections.
6. Validate responsive layouts at mobile, tablet, desktop breakpoints, adjusting grids as needed.
7. Update documentation (`AGENTS.md` or README) with any new utilities or architectural decisions introduced.
8. Confirm accessibility menu styling plays nicely with footer layout and dark/high-contrast modes.
