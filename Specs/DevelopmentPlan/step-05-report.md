# Step 05 Report â€” Accessibility Menu Engineering

## Work Completed
- Replaced the header dropdown with a fully featured accessibility menu (dark mode, high contrast, text sizing, dyslexia-friendly font, reduce motion) using ARIA-compliant controls and keyboard navigation.
- Implemented `scripts/accessibility-menu.js` to manage toggle state, persist preferences in `localStorage`, and sync UI state on every page load.
- Expanded `css/styles.css` with theme tokens for dark/high-contrast modes, text size scaling, Open Dyslexic font hosting, and motion-reduction overrides.
- Added local font scaffolding under `fonts/` and defined `@font-face` so the dyslexia toggle swaps to Open Dyslexic when files are supplied.
- Refined hero star artwork to match the design reference (central elongated sparkle with six supporting diamonds) and ensured motion respects the Reduce Motion preference.
- Synced privacy/accessibility sub-pages with the new accessibility menu markup so controls remain consistent site-wide.

## Outstanding / Follow-up
- Add the actual `OpenDyslexic-*.woff2` files to `fonts/` (see `fonts/README.md`) before launch so the dyslexia toggle loads correctly.
- Capture updated screenshots of dark mode, high contrast, and enlarged text states for design review.
- Consider automated regression tests (e.g., Playwright) to verify toggle persistence and ARIA roles across navigation.

## Verification Notes
- Manual QA: Each toggle updates the UI instantly, persists between reloads, and surfaces `aria-checked` states for assistive tech.
- Keyboard testing: Menu supports Tab/Shift+Tab looping, arrow navigation, Home/End, and Escape-to-close.
- Reduce Motion preference stops hero sparkle animation and disables transitions, complementing system-level `prefers-reduced-motion`.
